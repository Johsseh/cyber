(12, 'Trials', 'The usefulness of functions is greatly enhanced by the ability to pass information from the main body of code to the function and in the opposite direction, or between one function and another it is calling  Values that are sent to a function are called arguments.', 'I''ve used actual number here, but I could also have used variables.  There is something to watch out for with those variables!  Remember from the discussion about variables that variables have a scope?  This becomes very important here.  The function statement that defines a function is part of the function it defines; therefore variable defined in that same statement are also part of the function being defined; therefore their scope is local to the function.  This means that the variable''s lifetime begins when the function starts to be processed and ends when the function ends.  Consequently, these variables are not available in the main body of code (or in the calling function, if this function is being called from within another function.)  Simply using the same name won''t make it available!  In fact, using the same name in the main body of code will mean that you have two different variables with the same name.  This will not create an error, but it will certainly create a confusing program to work on!  It is best to use different names for the variables within your functions (another "be your own best friend" tip!)', '2016-03-17 21:12:15'),
